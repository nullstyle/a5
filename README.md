# A5-deno - a shameless port of A5Geo, a Global, equal-area, millimeter-accurate geospatial index

Website of the original, correct project and where you should probably be: [A5Geo.org](https://a5geo.org)

## An Explanation

So here's the deal.  The A5 geospatial indexing system seems pretty cool, and I'd love to play around with it.  That said, the tool ecosystem around javascript and typescript is a travesty, and I don't want to participate anymore.  I use deno when I can, bun+vite when I must, and node never if I can help it. So, given the original a5 project has been developed thusfar assuming node, I've forked this repo as a shamelessly minimal "port" using claude code to minimize my personal cost and to get my own projects that will be dependent upon a5 up and running on things like val.town and deno deploy.

You, Dear Reader, probably shouldn't use this library but iff'n yer so inclined, have at it.  Don't say I didn't warn you though... don't expect any support or warranty or anything but a prompt abandonment when my interests take me elsewhere.
