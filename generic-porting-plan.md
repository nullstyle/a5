# A5 Generic Porting Plan Template

This template outlines the steps required to port the A5 geospatial indexing library to another programming language. Replace **<LANGUAGE>** with the target language and update any environment‑specific notes as needed.

## 1. Environment Setup

1. Install or configure a modern development toolchain for **<LANGUAGE>**.
2. Ensure numerical libraries (for vectors, matrices, quaternions) are available or prepare lightweight equivalents.
3. Decide on a project structure that mirrors the module layout in the TypeScript implementation.

## 2. Core Modules to Implement

The library can be ported module by module. Follow the order below since later components build on earlier utilities.

1. **Mathematical Utilities**
   - Functions for degree/radian conversions and coordinate transformations.
   - Conversions between Cartesian, spherical, and custom coordinate systems.
   - Helpers for mapping points to pentagon faces (`toFace`, `FaceToIJ`, `IJToFace`, etc.).
2. **Warping and Projection Utilities**
   - Angle normalization and area‐preserving warp.
   - Gnomonic projection and its inverse between polar and spherical coordinates.
   - Combination of the above for projecting between planar pentagons and the sphere.
3. **Dodecahedron Origins**
   - Define the 12 face origins with orientation and rotation data.
   - Implement Hilbert curve helpers for moving between quintants and segments.
4. **Pentagon Geometry and Tiling**
   - Define the pentagon shape and basis vectors.
   - Construct pentagon vertices for a given resolution and apply flips/offsets.
5. **Hilbert Curve Conversion**
   - Convert between Hilbert curve indices and lattice coordinates, respecting orientation.
   - Provide helpers for deriving anchor offsets and computing indices.
6. **Serialization Format**
   - Encode cell identifiers as 64‑bit integers (or language equivalent).
   - Implement `serialize`, `deserialize`, and hierarchy operations (parent/child).
7. **Cell Operations**
   - Convert geographic coordinates to cell identifiers and back.
   - Build pentagon boundaries and hit tests for point containment.
   - Provide boundary and center retrieval in longitude/latitude.
8. **Hexadecimal Conversion**
   - Optional utilities for hex string encoding/decoding of cell IDs.
9. **Public API Entry Point**
   - Expose the functions above as a cohesive API for **<LANGUAGE>** projects.
   - Ensure exports and typing/metadata match conventions of **<LANGUAGE>**.

## 3. Usage Examples and Testing

1. Recreate CLI or application examples in **<LANGUAGE>** to verify functionality.
2. Translate existing unit tests or create new ones to cover key algorithms.
3. Validate correctness by comparing against the TypeScript implementation or known outputs.

## 4. Deployment Considerations

1. Package the library for distribution according to **<LANGUAGE>** standards.
2. Provide documentation for installation and usage in the new environment.
3. Maintain parity with future updates of the TypeScript version when possible.

Use this document as a starting point for your port. Adapt terminology and tooling details as necessary for the target language and its ecosystem.
